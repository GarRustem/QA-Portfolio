# QA_Portfolio

This repository contains some of my works for Java (simple calculator), LoadRunner ("WebTours" load test), MySQL (solving 3 tasks including JOIN selections) and Manual testing (Employee Service and Bank Form).

In general way of my education as QA and Load Test engineer, I studied from theory to practice by books (like «Тестирование программного обеспечения. Базовый курс», Святослав Куликов), with YouTube channels (freeCodeCamp.org, Artsiom Rusau QA Life, QA START UP and others) and official documentations from developers resources (LoadRunner, JMeter, Postman, Fiddler, Charles Proxy).

Additional, for studying Git, MySQL, HTTP, API, OSI model and TCP/IP model, HTML and CSS, I have used many helpful resources such as w3schools.com, dev.mysql.com, htmlbook.ru, habr.com, git-scm.com and stackoverflow.com.
